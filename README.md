# 8-bit-Ninja
Summer 2018 Masters Project


The purpose of this project was to create a simple game using original assets that focused on the player having to pay attention to enemy animations and react accordingly to survive each wave and fight the boss on the final wave. This project also serves as a medium to demonstrate how much work goes into creating the simplest of games, focusing mainly on gameplay and character mechanics as well as sprite animations to visualize the scripted mechanics of the player and enemies.
